I am indeed, sir, a surgeon to old shoes; when they are in great danger, I recover them. As proper men as ever trod upon neat’s leather have gone upon my handiwork</p>

			<p class="verseline">The livelong day with patient expectation</p>
			<p class="verseline">To see great Pompey pass the streets of Rome</p>

			<p class="verseline">I’ll leave you</p>

			<p class="verseline">I have not from your eyes that gentleness</p>
			<p class="verseline">And show of love as I was wont to have;</p>
			<p class="verseline">You bear too stubborn and too strange a hand</p>
			<p class="verseline">Over your friend that loves you</p>
			<p class="character">Brutus</p>
			<p class="verseline">Cassius,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Be not deceived; if I have veil’d my look,</p>
			<p class="verseline">I turn the trouble of my countenance</p>
			<p class="verseline">Merely upon myself. Vexed I am</p>
			<p class="verseline">Of late with passions of some difference,</p>

			<p class="verseline">Nor construe any further my neglect</p>
			<p class="verseline">Than that poor Brutus with himself at war</p>
			<p class="verseline">Forgets the shows of love to other men</p>
			<p class="character">Cassius</p>
			<p class="verseline">Then, Brutus, I have much mistook your passion,</p>
			<p class="verseline">By means whereof this breast of mine hath buried</p>
			<p class="verseline">Thoughts of great value, worthy cogitations</p>
			<p class="verseline">Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your face?</p>
			<p class="character">Brutus</p>
			<p class="verseline">No, Cassius, for the eye sees not itself</p>
			<p class="verseline">But by reflection, by some other things</p>
			<p class="character">Cassius</p>
			<p class="verseline">‘Tis just,</p>
			<p class="verseline">And it is very much lamented, Brutus,</p>
			<p class="verseline">That you have no such mirrors as will turn</p>
			<p class="verseline">Your hidden worthiness into your eye</p>
			<p class="verseline">That you might see your shadow. I have heard</p>
			<p class="verseline">Where many of the best respect in Rome,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Except immortal Caesar, speaking of Brutus</p>
			<p class="verseline">And groaning underneath this age’s yoke,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Have wish’d that noble Brutus had his eyes</p>
			<p class="character">Brutus</p>
			<p class="verseline">Into what dangers would you lead me, Cassius,</p>
			<p class="verseline">That you would have me seek into myself</p>
			<p class="verseline">For that which is not in me?</p>
			<p class="character">Cassius</p>
			<p class="verseline">Therefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear,</p>
			<p class="verseline">And since you know you cannot see yourself</p>
			<p class="verseline">So well as by reflection, I your glass</p>
			<p class="verseline">Will modestly discover to yourself</p>
			<p class="verseline">That of yourself which you yet know not of</p>
			<p class="verseline">And be not jealous on me, gentle Brutus;</p>
			<p class="verseline">Were I a common laugher, or did use</p>
			<p class="verseline">To stale with ordinary oaths my love</p>
			<p class="verseline">To every new protester, if you know</p>
			<p class="verseline">That I do fawn on men and hug them hard</p>
			<p class="verseline">And after scandal them, or if you know</p>
			<p class="verseline">That I profess myself in banqueting</p>
			<p class="verseline">To all the rout, then hold me dangerous</p>
			<p class="inline_stagedirections">Flourish and shout</p>
			<p class="character">Brutus</p>
			<p class="verseline">What means this shouting? I do fear the people</p>
			<p class="verseline">Choose Caesar for their king</p>
			<p class="character">Cassius</p>
			<p class="verseline">Ay, do you fear it?</p>
			<p class="verseline">Then must I think you would not have it so</p>
			<p class="character">Brutus</p>
			<p class="verseline">I would not, Cassius, yet I love him well</p>
			<p class="verseline">But wherefore do you hold me here so long?</p>
			<p class="verseline">What is it that you would impart to me?</p>
			<p class="verseline">If it be aught toward the general good,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Set honour in one eye and death I’ the other</p>
			<p class="verseline">And I will look on both indifferently</p>
			<p class="verseline">For let the gods so speed me as I love</p>
			<p class="verseline">The name of honour more than I fear death</p>
			<p class="character">Cassius</p>
			<p class="verseline">I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus,</p>
			<p class="verseline">As well as I do know your outward favour</p>
			<p class="verseline">Well, honour is the subject of my story</p>
			<p class="verseline">I cannot tell what you and other men</p>
			<p class="verseline">Think of this life, but, for my single self,</p>
			<p class="verseline">I had as lief not be as live to be</p>
			<p class="verseline">In awe of such a thing as I myself</p>
			<p class="verseline">I was born free as Caesar, so were you;</p>
			<p class="verseline">We both have fed as well, and we can both</p>
			<p class="verseline">Endure the winter’s cold as well as he</p>
			<p class="verseline">For once, upon a raw and gusty day,</p>
			<p class="verseline">The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Caesar said to me, “Darest thou, Cassius, now</p>
			<p class="verseline">Leap in with me into this angry flood</p>
			<p class="verseline">And swim to yonder point?” Upon the word,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Accoutred as I was, I plunged in</p>
			<p class="verseline">And bade him follow. So indeed he did</p>
			<p class="verseline">The torrent roar’d, and we did buffet it</p>
			<p class="verseline">With lusty sinews, throwing it aside</p>
			<p class="verseline">And stemming it with hearts of controversy</p>
			<p class="verseline">But ere we could arrive the point proposed,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Caesar cried, “Help me, Cassius, or I sink!</p>
			<p class="verseline">I, as Aeneas our great ancestor</p>
			<p class="verseline">Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder</p>
			<p class="verseline">The old Anchises bear, so from the waves of Tiber</p>
			<p class="verseline">Did I the tired Caesar. And this man</p>
			<p class="verseline">Is now become a god, and Cassius is</p>
			<p class="verseline">A wretched creature and must bend his body</p>
			<p class="verseline">If Caesar carelessly but nod on him</p>
			<p class="verseline">He had a fever when he was in Spain,</p>
			<p class="verseline">And when the fit was on him I did mark</p>
			<p class="verseline">How he did shake. ‘Tis true, this god did shake;</p>
			<p class="verseline">His coward lips did from their colour fly,</p>
			<p class="verseline">And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world</p>
			<p class="verseline">Did lose his luster. I did hear him groan</p>
			<p class="verseline">Ay, and that tongue of his that bade the Romans</p>
			<p class="verseline">Mark him and write his speeches in their books,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Alas, it cried, “Give me some drink, Titinius,”</p>
			<p class="verseline">As a sick girl. Ye gods! It doth amaze me</p>
			<p class="verseline">A man of such a feeble temper should</p>
			<p class="verseline">So get the start of the majestic world</p>
			<p class="verseline">And bear the palm alone.</p>
			<p class="inline_stagedirections">Shout. Flourish</p>
			<p class="character">Brutus</p>
			<p class="verseline">Another general shout!</p>
			<p class="verseline">I do believe that these applauses are</p>
			<p class="verseline">For some new honours that are heap’d on Caesar</p>
			<p class="character">Cassius</p>
			<p class="verseline">Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world</p>
			<p class="verseline">Like a Colossus, and we petty men</p>
			<p class="verseline">Walk under his huge legs and peep about</p>
			<p class="verseline">To find ourselves dishonourable graves</p>
			<p class="verseline">Men at some time are masters of their fates:</p>
			<p class="verseline">The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,</p>
			<p class="verseline">But in ourselves that we are underlings</p>
			<p class="verseline">Brutus and Caesar: what should be in that “Caesar”?</p>
			<p class="verseline">Why should that name be sounded more than yours?</p>
			<p class="verseline">Write them together, yours is as fair a name;</p>
			<p class="verseline">Sound them, it doth become the mouth as well;</p>
			<p class="verseline">Weigh them, it is as heavy; conjure with ‘em,</p>
			<p class="verseline">“Brutus” will start a spirit as soon as “Caesar.”</p>
			<p class="verseline">Now, in the names of all the gods at once,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed</p>
			<p class="verseline">That he is grown so great? Age, thou art shamed!</p>
			<p class="verseline">Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods!</p>
			<p class="verseline">When went there by an age since the great flood</p>
			<p class="verseline">But it was famed with more than with one man?</p>
			<p class="verseline">When could they say till now that talk’d of Rome</p>
			<p class="verseline">That her wide walls encompass’d but one man?</p>
			<p class="verseline">Now is it Rome indeed, and room enough,</p>
			<p class="verseline">When there is in it but one only man</p>
			<p class="verseline">O, you and I have heard our fathers say</p>
			<p class="verseline">There was a Brutus once that would have brook’d</p>
			<p class="verseline">The eternal devil to keep his state in Rome</p>
			<p class="verseline">As easily as a king</p>
			<p class="character">Brutus</p>
			<p class="verseline">That you do love me, I am nothing jealous;</p>
			<p class="verseline">What you would work me to, I have some aim</p>
			<p class="verseline">How I have thought of this and of these times,</p>
			<p class="verseline">I shall recount hereafter; for this present,</p>
			<p class="verseline">I would not, so with love I might entreat you,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Be any further moved. What you have said</p>
			<p class="verseline">I will consider; what you have to say</p>
			<p class="verseline">I will with patience hear, and find a time</p>
			<p class="verseline">Both meet to hear and answer such high things</p>
			<p class="verseline">Till then, my noble friend, chew upon this:</p>
			<p class="verseline">Brutus had rather be a villager</p>
			<p class="verseline">Than to repute himself a son of Rome</p>
			<p class="verseline">Under these hard conditions as this time</p>
			<p class="verseline">Is like to lay upon us</p>
			<p class="character">Cassius</p>
			<p class="verseline">I am glad that my weak words</p>
			<p class="verseline">Have struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus</p>
			<h2 class="stage_directions">Re-enter Caesar and his Train</h2>
			<p class="character">Brutus</p>
			<p class="verseline">The games are done, and Caesar is returning</p>
			<p class="character">Cassius</p>
			<p class="verseline">As they pass by, pluck Casca by the sleeve,</p>
			<p class="verseline">And he will, after his sour fashion, tell you</p>
			<p class="verseline">What hath proceeded worthy note today</p>
			<p class="character">Brutus</p>
			<p class="verseline">I will do so. But, look you, Cassius,</p>
			<p class="verseline">The angry spot doth glow on Caesar’s brow,</p>
			<p class="verseline">And all the rest look like a chidden train:</p>
			<p class="verseline">Calpurnia’s cheek is pale, and Cicero</p>
			<p class="verseline">Looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes</p>
			<p class="verseline">As we have seen him in the Capitol,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Being cross’d in conference by some senators</p>
			<p class="character">Cassius</p>
			<p class="verseline">Casca will tell us what the matter is</p>
			<p class="character">Caesar</p>
			<p class="verseline">Antonio!</p>
			<p class="character">Antony</p>
			<p class="verseline">Caesar?</p>
			<p class="character">Caesar</p>
			<p class="verseline">Let me have men about me that are fat,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Sleek-headed men, and such as sleep o’ nights:</p>
			<p class="verseline">Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look;</p>
			<p class="verseline">He thinks too much; such men are dangerous</p>
			<p class="character">Antony</p>
			<p class="verseline">Fear him not, Caesar; he’s not dangerous;</p>
			<p class="verseline">He is a noble Roman and well given</p>
			<p class="character">Caesar</p>
			<p class="verseline">Would he were fatter! But I fear him not,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Yet if my name were liable to fear,</p>
			<p class="verseline">I do not know the man I should avoid</p>
			<p class="verseline">So soon as that spare Cassius. He reads much,</p>
			<p class="verseline">He is a great observer, and he looks</p>
			<p class="verseline">Quite through the deeds of men. He loves no plays,</p>
			<p class="verseline">As thou dost, Antony; he hears no music;</p>
			<p class="verseline">Seldom he smiles, and smiles in such a sort</p>
			<p class="verseline">As if he mock’d himself and scorn’d his spirit</p>
			<p class="verseline">That could be moved to smile at anything</p>
			<p class="verseline">Such men as he be never at heart’s ease</p>
			<p class="verseline">Whiles they behold a greater than themselves,</p>
			<p class="verseline">And therefore are they very dangerous</p>
			<p class="verseline">I rather tell thee what is to be fear’d</p>
			<p class="verseline">Than what I fear, for always I am Caesar</p>
			<p class="verseline">Come on my right hand, for this ear is deaf,</p>
			<p class="verseline">And tell me truly what thou think’st of him</p>
			<p class="inline_stagedirections">Sennet. Exeunt Caesar and all his Train but Casca</p>
			<p class="character">Casca</p>
			<p class="verseline">You pull’d me by the cloak; would you speak with me?</p>
			<p class="character">Brutus</p>
			<p class="verseline">Ay, Casca, tell us what hath chanced today</p>
			<p class="verseline">That Caesar looks so sad</p>
			<p class="character">Casca</p>
			<p class="verseline">Why, you were with him, were you not?</p>
			<p class="character">Brutus</p>
			<p class="verseline">I should not then ask Casca what had chanced</p>
			<p class="character">Casca</p>
			<p class="verseline">Why, there was a crown offered him, and being offered him,</p>
			<p class="verseline">he put it by with the back of his hand, thus, and then the</p>
			<p class="verseline">people fell ashouting</p>
			<p class="character">Brutus</p>
			<p class="verseline">What was the second noise for?</p>
			<p class="character">Casca</p>
			<p class="verseline">Why, for that too</p>
			<p class="character">Cassius</p>
			<p class="verseline">They shouted thrice. What was the last cry for?</p>
			<p class="character">Casca</p>
			<p class="verseline">Why, for that too</p>
			<p class="character">Brutus</p>
			<p class="verseline">Was the crown offered him thrice?</p>
			<p class="character">Casca</p>
			<p class="prose">Ay, marry, wast, and he put it by thrice, every time gentler than other, and at every putting by mine honest neighbours shouted</p>
			<p class="character">Cassius</p>
			<p class="verseline">Who offered him the crown?</p>
			<p class="character">Casca</p>
			<p class="verseline">Why, Antony</p>
			<p class="character">Brutus</p>
			<p class="verseline">Tell us the manner of it, gentle Casca</p>
			<p class="character">Casca</p>
			<p class="prose">I can as well be hang’d as tell the manner of it. It was mere foolery; I did not mark it. I saw Mark Antony offer him a crown (yet ‘twas not a crown neither, ‘twas one of these coronets) and, as I told you, he put it by once. But for all that, to my thinking, he would fain have had it. Then he offered it to him again; then he put it by again. But, to my thinking, he was very loath to lay his fingers off it. And then he offered it the third time; he put it the third time by; and still as he refused it, the rabblement hooted and clapped their chopped hands and threw up their sweaty nightcaps and uttered such a deal of stinking breath because Caesar refused the crown that it had almost choked Caesar, for he swounded and fell down at it. And for mine own part, I durst not laugh for fear of opening my lips and receiving the bad air</p>
			<p class="character">Cassius</p>
			<p class="verseline">But, soft, I pray you, what, did Caesar’s wound?</p>
			<p class="character">Casca</p>
			<p class="prose">He fell down in the marketplace and foamed at mouth and was speechless</p>
			<p class="character">Brutus</p>
			<p class="verseline">‘Tis very like. He hath the falling sickness</p>
			<p class="character">Cassius</p>
			<p class="verseline">No, Caesar hath it not, but you, and I,</p>
			<p class="verseline">And honest Casca, we have the falling sickness</p>
			<p class="character">Casca</p>
			<p class="prose">I know not what you mean by that, but I am sure Caesar fell down. If the tagrag people did not clap him and hiss him according as he pleased and displeased them, as they use to do the players in the theatre, I am no true man</p>
			<p class="character">Brutus</p>
			<p class="verseline">What said he when he came unto himself?</p>
			<p class="character">Casca</p>
			<p class="prose">Marry, before he fell down, when he perceived the common herd was glad he refused the crown, he plucked me ope his doublet and offered them his throat to cut. An had been a man of any occupation, if I would not have taken him at a word, I would I might go to hell among the rogues. And so he fell. When he came to himself again, he said, if he had done or said anything amiss, he desired their worships to think it was his infirmity. Three or four wenches where I stood cried, “Alas, good soul!” and forgave him with all their hearts. But there’s no heed to be taken of them; if Caesar had stabbed their mothers, they would have done no less</p>
			<p class="character">Brutus</p>
			<p class="verseline">And after that he came, thus sad, away?</p>
			<p class="character">Casca</p>
			<p class="verseline">Ay</p>
			<p class="character">Cassius</p>
			<p class="verseline">Did Cicero say anything?</p>
			<p class="character">Casca</p>
			<p class="verseline">Ay, he spoke Greek</p>
			<p class="character">Cassius</p>
			<p class="verseline">To what effect?</p>
			<p class="character">Casca</p>
			<p class="prose">Nay, an I tell you that, I’ll ne’er look you I’ the face again; but those that understood him smiled at one another and shook their heads; but for mine own part, it was Greek to me. I could tell you more news too: Marullus and Flavius, for pulling scarfs off Caesar’s images, are put to silence. Fare you well</p>
			<p class="verseline">There was more foolery yet, if could remember it</p>
			<p class="character">Cassius</p>
			<p class="verseline">Will you sup with me tonight, Casca?</p>
			<p class="character">Casca</p>
			<p class="verseline">No, I am promised forth</p>
			<p class="character">Cassius</p>
			<p class="verseline">Will you dine with me tomorrow?</p>
			<p class="character">Casca</p>
			<p class="prose">Ay, if I be alive, and your mind hold, and your dinner worth the eating</p>
			<p class="character">Cassius</p>
			<p class="verseline">Good, I will expect you</p>
			<p class="character">Casca</p>
			<p class="verseline">Do so, farewell, both.</p>
			<p class="inline_stagedirections">Exit</p>
			<p class="character">Brutus</p>
			<p class="verseline">What a blunt fellow is this grown to be!</p>
			<p class="verseline">He was quick mettle when he went to school</p>
			<p class="character">Cassius</p>
			<p class="verseline">So is he now in execution</p>
			<p class="verseline">Of any bold or noble enterprise,</p>
			<p class="verseline">However he puts on this tardy form</p>
			<p class="verseline">This rudeness is a sauce to his good wit,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Which gives men stomach to digest his words</p>
			<p class="verseline">With better appetite</p>
			<p class="character">Brutus</p>
			<p class="verseline">And so it is. For this time I will leave you</p>
			<p class="verseline">Tomorrow, if you please to speak with me,</p>
			<p class="verseline">I will come home to you, or, if you will,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Come home to me and I will wait for you</p>

			<p class="verseline">I will do so. Till then, think of the world</p>
			<p class="inline_stagedirections">Exit Brutus</p>
			<p class="verseline">Well, Brutus, thou art noble; yet, I see</p>
			<p class="verseline">Thy honourable mettle may be wrought</p>
			<p class="verseline">From that it is disposed; therefore it is meet</p>
			<p class="verseline">That noble minds keep ever with their likes;</p>
			<p class="verseline">For who so firm that cannot be seduced?</p>
			<p class="verseline">Caesar doth bear me hard, but he loves Brutus</p>
			<p class="verseline">If I were Brutus now and he were Cassius,</p>
			<p class="verseline">He should not humour me. I will this night,</p>
			<p class="verseline">In several hands, in at his windows throw,</p>

			<p class="verseline">Writings, all tending to the great opinion</p>
			<p class="verseline">That Rome holds of his name, wherein obscurely</p>
			<p class="verseline">Caesar’s ambition shall be glanced at</p>
			<p class="verseline">And after this let Caesar seat him sure;</p>

			<p class="character">Cicero</p>
			<p class="verseline">Good even, Casca. Brought you Caesar home?</p>
			<p class="verseline">Why are you breathless, and why stare you so?</p>
			<p class="character">Casca</p>
			<p class="verseline">Are not you moved, when all the sway of earth</p>
			<p class="verseline">Shakes like a thing unfirm? O Cicero,</p>
			<p class="verseline">I have seen tempests when the scolding winds</p>
			<p class="verseline">Have rived the knotty oaks, and I have seen</p>
			<p class="verseline">The ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam</p>
			<p class="verseline">To be exalted with the threatening clouds,</p>
			<p class="verseline">But never till tonight, never till now,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Did I go through a tempest dropping fire</p>
			<p class="verseline">Either there is a civil strife in heaven,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Or else the world too saucy with the gods</p>
			<p class="verseline">Incenses them to send destruction</p>
			<p class="character">Cicero</p>
			<p class="verseline">Why, saw you anything more wonderful?</p>
			<p class="character">Casca</p>
			<p class="verseline">A common slave- you know him well by sight-</p>
			<p class="verseline">Held up his left hand, which did flame and burn</p>
			<p class="verseline">Like twenty torches join’d, and yet his hand</p>
			<p class="verseline">Not sensible of fire remain’d unscorch’d</p>
			<p class="verseline">Besides- I ha’ not since put up my sword-</p>
			<p class="verseline">Against the Capitol I met a lion,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Who glaz’d upon me and went surly by</p>
			<p class="verseline">Without annoying me. And there were drawn</p>
			<p class="verseline">Upon a heap a hundred ghastly women</p>
			<p class="verseline">Transformed with their fear, who swore they saw</p>
			<p class="verseline">Men all in fire walk up and down the streets</p>
			<p class="verseline">And yesterday the bird of night did sit</p>

			<p class="verseline">Indeed, it is a strange-disposed time</p>

			<h2 class="stage_directions">Enter Cassius</h2>
			<p class="character">Cassius</p>
			<p class="verseline">Who’s there?</p>
			<p class="character">Casca</p>
			<p class="verseline">A Roman</p>
			<p class="character">Cassius</p>
			<p class="verseline">Casca, by your voice</p>
			<p class="character">Casca</p>
			<p class="verseline">Your ear is good. Cassius, what night is this!</p>
			<p class="character">Cassius</p>
			<p class="verseline">A very pleasing night to honest men</p>
			<p class="character">Casca</p>
			<p class="verseline">Who ever knew the heavens menace so?</p>
			<p class="character">Cassius</p>
			<p class="verseline">Those that have known the earth so full of faults</p>
			<p class="verseline">For my part, I have walk’d about the streets,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Submitting me unto the perilous night,</p>
			<p class="verseline">And thus unbraced, Casca, as you see,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Have bared my bosom to the thunderstone;</p>
			<p class="verseline">And when the cross blue lightning seem’d to open</p>
			<p class="verseline">The breast of heaven, I did present myself</p>
			<p class="verseline">Even in the aim and very flash of it</p>
			<p class="character">Casca</p>
			<p class="verseline">But wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens?</p>
			<p class="verseline">It is the part of men to fear and tremble</p>
			<p class="verseline">When the most mighty gods by tokens send</p>
			<p class="verseline">Such dreadful heralds to astonish us</p>
			<p class="character">Cassius</p>
			<p class="verseline">You are dull, Casca, and those sparks of life</p>
			<p class="verseline">That should be in a Roman you do want,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Or else you use not. You look pale and gaze</p>
			<p class="verseline">And put on fear and cast yourself in wonder</p>
			<p class="verseline">To see the strange impatience of the heavens</p>
			<p class="verseline">But if you would consider the true cause</p>
			<p class="verseline">Why all these fires, why all these gliding ghosts,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Why birds and beasts from quality and kind,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Why old men, fools, and children calculate,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Why all these things change from their ordinance,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Their natures, and preformed faculties</p>
			<p class="verseline">To monstrous quality, why, you shall find</p>
			<p class="verseline">That heaven hath infused them with these spirits</p>
			<p class="verseline">To make them instruments of fear and warning</p>
			<p class="verseline">Unto some monstrous state</p>
			<p class="verseline">Now could I, Casca, name to thee a man</p>
			<p class="verseline">Most like this dreadful night,</p>
			<p class="verseline">That thunders, lightens, opens graves, and roars</p>
			<p class="verseline">As doth the lion in the Capitol,</p>
			<p class="verseline">A man no mightier than thyself or me</p>
			<p class="verseline">In personal action, yet prodigious grown</p>
			<p class="verseline">And fearful, as these strange eruptions are</p>
			<p class="character">Casca</p>
			<p class="verseline">‘Tis Caesar that you mean, is it not, Cassius?</p>
			<p class="character">Cassius</p>
			<p class="verseline">Let it be who it is, for Romans now</p>
			<p class="verseline">Have thews and limbs like to their ancestors</p>
			<p class="verseline">But, woe the while! Our fathers’ minds are dead,</p>
			<p class="verseline">And we are govern’d with our mothers’ spirits;</p>
			<p class="verseline">Our yoke and sufferance show us womanish</p>
			<p class="character">Casca</p>
			<p class="verseline">Indeed they say the senators tomorrow</p>
			<p class="verseline">Mean to establish Caesar as a king,</p>
			<p class="verseline">And he shall wear his crown by sea and land</p>
			<p class="verseline">In every place save here in Italy</p>
			<p class="character">Cassius</p>
			<p class="verseline">I know where I will wear this dagger then:</p>
			<p class="verseline">Cassius from bondage will deliver Cassius</p>
			<p class="verseline">Therein, ye gods, you make the weak most strong;</p>
			<p class="verseline">Therein, ye gods, you tyrants do defeat</p>
			<p class="verseline">Nor stony tower, nor walls of beaten brass,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Nor airless dungeon, nor strong links of iron</p>
			<p class="verseline">Can be retentive to the strength of spirit;</p>
			<p class="verseline">But life, being weary of these worldly bars,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Never lacks power to dismiss itself</p>
			<p class="verseline">If I know this, know all the world besides,</p>
			<p class="verseline">That part of tyranny that I do bear</p>
			<p class="verseline">I can shake off at pleasure. Thunder still</p>
			<p class="character">Casca</p>
			<p class="verseline">So can I</p>
			<p class="verseline">So every bondman in his own hand bears</p>
			<p class="verseline">The power to cancel his captivity</p>
			<p class="character">Cassius</p>
			<p class="verseline">And why should Caesar be a tyrant then?</p>
			<p class="verseline">Poor man! I know he would not be a wolf</p>
			<p class="verseline">But that he sees the Romans are but sheep</p>
			<p class="verseline">He were no lion, were not Romans hinds</p>
			<p class="verseline">Those that with haste will make a mighty fire</p>
			<p class="verseline">Begin it with weak straws. What trash is Rome,</p>
			<p class="verseline">What rubbish, and what offal, when it serves</p>
			<p class="verseline">For the base matter to illuminate</p>
			<p class="verseline">So vile a thing as Caesar? But, O grief,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Where hast thou led me? I perhaps speak this</p>
			<p class="verseline">Before a willing bondman; then I know</p>
			<p class="verseline">My answer must be made. But I am arm’d,</p>
			<p class="verseline">And dangers are to me indifferent</p>
			<p class="character">Casca</p>
			<p class="verseline">You speak to Casca, and to such a man</p>
			<p class="verseline">That is no fleering tell-tale. Hold, my hand</p>
			<p class="verseline">Be factious for redress of all these griefs,</p>
			<p class="verseline">And I will set this foot of mine as far</p>
			<p class="verseline">As who goes farthest</p>
			<p class="character">Cassius</p>
			<p class="verseline">There’s a bargain made</p>
			<p class="verseline">Now know you, Casca, I have moved already</p>
			<p class="verseline">Some certain of the noblest-minded Romans</p>
			<p class="verseline">To undergo with me an enterprise</p>
			<p class="verseline">Of honourable-dangerous consequence;</p>
			<p class="verseline">And I do know by this, they stay for me</p>
			<p class="verseline">In Pompey’s Porch. For now, this fearful night,</p>

			<p class="verseline">And the complexion of the element</p>

			<p class="verseline">Caesar must bleed for it! And, gentle friends,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Let’s kill him boldly, but not wrathfully;</p>
			<p class="verseline">Let’s carve him as a dish fit for the gods,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds;</p>
			<p class="verseline">And let our hearts, as subtle masters do,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Stir up their servants to an act of rage</p>
			<p class="verseline">And after seem to chide ‘em. This shall make</p>

			<p class="character">Decius</p>
			<p class="verseline">Never fear that. If he be so resolved,</p>

			<p class="prose">Romans, countrymen, and lovers! Hear me for my cause, and besilent, that you may hear. Believe me for mine honour, and haverespect to mine honour, that you may believe. Censure me in your wisdom, and awake your senses, that you may the better judge. If there be any in this assembly, any dear friend of Caesar’s, to him I say that Brutus’ love to Caesar was no less than his. If then that friend demand why Brutus rose against Caesar, this is my answer: Not that I loved Caesar less, but that I loved Rome more. Had you rather Caesar were living and die all slaves, than that Caesar were dead to live all freemen? As Caesar loved me, I weep for him; as he was fortunate, I rejoice at it; as he was valiant, I honour him; but as he was ambitious, I slew him. There is tears for his love, joy for his fortune, honour for his valour,and death for his ambition. Who is here so base that would be abondman? If any, speak, for him have I offended. Who is here so rude that would not be a Roman? If any, speak, for him have I offended. Who is here so vile that will not love his country? If any, speak, for him have I offended. I pause for a reply</p>
			<p class="character">All</p>
			<p class="verseline">None, Brutus, none</p>
			<p class="character">Brutus</p>
			<p class="prose">Then none have I offended. I have done no more to Caesar than you shall do to Brutus. The question of his death is enrolled in the Capitol, his glory not extenuated, wherein he was worthy, nor his offenses enforced, for which he suffered death</p>

			<p class="prose">Here comes his body, mourned by Mark Antony, who, though he had no hand in his death, shall receive the benefit of his dying, a place in the commonwealth, as which of you shall not? With this I depart- that, as I slew my best lover for the good of Rome, I have the same dagger for myself, when it shall please my country to need my death</p>

			<p class="character">Antony</p>
			<p class="verseline">Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears!</p>
			<p class="verseline">I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him</p>
			<p class="verseline">The evil that men do lives after them,</p>
			<p class="verseline">The good is oft interred with their bones;</p>
			<p class="verseline">So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus</p>
			<p class="verseline">Hath told you Caesar was ambitious;</p>
			<p class="verseline">If it were so, it was a grievous fault,</p>
			<p class="verseline">And grievously hath Caesar answer’d it</p>
			<p class="verseline">Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest-</p>
			<p class="verseline">For Brutus is an honourable man;</p>
			<p class="verseline">So are they all, all honourable men-</p>
			<p class="verseline">Come I to speak in Caesar’s funeral</p>
			<p class="verseline">He was my friend, faithful and just to me;</p>
			<p class="verseline">But Brutus says he was ambitious,</p>
			<p class="verseline">And Brutus is an honourable man</p>
			<p class="verseline">He hath brought many captives home to Rome,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill</p>
			<p class="verseline">Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?</p>
			<p class="verseline">When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept;</p>
			<p class="verseline">Ambition should be made of sterner stuff:</p>
			<p class="verseline">Yet Brutus says he was ambitious,</p>
			<p class="verseline">And Brutus is an honourable man</p>
			<p class="verseline">You all did see that on the Lupercal</p>
			<p class="verseline">I thrice presented him a kingly crown,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition?</p>
			<p class="verseline">Yet Brutus says he was ambitious,</p>
			<p class="verseline">And sure he is an honourable man</p>
			<p class="verseline">I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,</p>
			<p class="verseline">But here I am to speak what I do know</p>
			<p class="verseline">You all did love him once, not without cause;</p>
			<p class="verseline">What cause withholds you then to mourn for him?</p>
			<p class="verseline">O judgement, thou art fled to brutish beasts,</p>
			<p class="verseline">And men have lost their reason. Bear with me;</p>
			<p class="verseline">My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar,</p>
			<p class="verseline">And I must pause till it come back to me</p>
			<p class="character">First Citizen</p>
			<p class="verseline">Methinks there is much reason in his sayings</p>
			<p class="character">Second Citizen</p>
			<p class="verseline">If thou consider rightly of the matter,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Caesar has had great wrong</p>
			<p class="character">Third Citizen</p>
			<p class="verseline">Has he, masters?</p>
			<p class="verseline">I fear there will a worse come in his place</p>
			<p class="character">Fourth Citizen</p>
			<p class="verseline">Mark’d ye his words? He would not take the crown;</p>
			<p class="verseline">Therefore ‘tis certain he was not ambitious</p>
			<p class="character">First Citizen</p>
			<p class="verseline">If it be found so, some will dear abide it</p>
			<p class="character">Second Citizen</p>
			<p class="verseline">Poor soul, his eyes are red as fire with weeping</p>
			<p class="character">Third Citizen</p>
			<p class="verseline">There’s not a nobler man in Rome than Antony</p>
			<p class="character">Fourth Citizen</p>
			<p class="verseline">Now mark him, he begins again to speak</p>
			<p class="character">Antony</p>
			<p class="verseline">But yesterday the word of Caesar might</p>
			<p class="verseline">Have stood against the world. Now lies he there,</p>
			<p class="verseline">And none so poor to do him reverence</p>
			<p class="verseline">O masters! If I were disposed to stir</p>
			<p class="verseline">Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage,</p>
			<p class="verseline">I should do Brutus wrong and Cassius wrong,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Who, you all know, are honourable men</p>
			<p class="verseline">I will not do them wrong; I rather choose</p>
			<p class="verseline">To wrong the dead, to wrong myself and you,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Than I will wrong such honourable men</p>
			<p class="verseline">But here’s a parchment with the seal of Caesar;</p>
			<p class="verseline">I found it in his closet, ‘tis his will</p>
			<p class="verseline">Let but the commons hear this testament-</p>
			<p class="verseline">Which, pardon me, I do not mean to read-</p>
			<p class="verseline">And they would go and kiss dead Caesar’s wounds</p>
			<p class="verseline">And dip their napkins in his sacred blood,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Yea, beg a hair of him for memory,</p>
			<p class="verseline">And, dying, mention it within their wills,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Bequeathing it as a rich legacy</p>
			<p class="verseline">Unto their issue</p>
			<p class="character">Fourth Citizen</p>
			<p class="verseline">We’ll hear the will. Read it, Mark Antony</p>
			<p class="character">All</p>
			<p class="verseline">The will, the will! We will hear Caesar’s will</p>
			<p class="character">Antony</p>
			<p class="verseline">Have patience, gentle friends, I must not read it;</p>
			<p class="verseline">It is not meet you know how Caesar loved you</p>
			<p class="verseline">You are not wood, you are not stones, but men;</p>
			<p class="verseline">And, being men, hearing the will of Caesar,</p>
			<p class="verseline">It will inflame you, it will make you mad</p>
			<p class="verseline">‘Tis good you know not that you are his heirs,</p>

			<p class="character">Fourth Citizen</p>
			<p class="verseline">Read the will; we’ll hear it, Antony</p>
			<p class="verseline">You shall read us the will, Caesar’s will</p>
			<p class="character">Antony</p>
			<p class="verseline">Will you be patient? Will you stay awhile?</p>
			<p class="verseline">I have o’ershot myself to tell you of it</p>
			<p class="verseline">I fear I wrong the honourable men</p>
			<p class="verseline">Whose daggers have stabb’d Caesar; I do fear it</p>
			<p class="character">Fourth Citizen</p>

			<p class="verseline">You all do know this mantle. I remember</p>
			<p class="verseline">The first time ever Caesar put it on;</p>
			<p class="verseline">‘Twas on a summer’s evening, in his tent,</p>
			<p class="verseline">That day he overcame the Nervii</p>
			<p class="verseline">Look, in this place ran Cassius’ dagger through;</p>
			<p class="verseline">See what a rent the envious Casca made;</p>
			<p class="verseline">Through this the well-beloved Brutus stabb’d;</p>
			<p class="verseline">And as he pluck’d his cursed steel away,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Mark how the blood of Caesar follow’d it,</p>
			<p class="verseline">As rushing out of doors, to be resolved</p>
			<p class="verseline">If Brutus so unkindly knock’d, or no;</p>
			<p class="verseline">For Brutus, as you know, was Caesar’s angel</p>
			<p class="verseline">Judge, O you gods, how dearly Caesar loved him!</p>
			<p class="verseline">This was the most unkindest cut of all;</p>
			<p class="verseline">For when the noble Caesar saw him stab,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Ingratitude, more strong than traitors’ arms,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Quite vanquish’d him. Then burst his mighty heart,</p>
			<p class="verseline">And, in his mantle muffling up his face,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Even at the base of Pompey’s statue,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Which all the while ran blood, great Caesar fell</p>
			<p class="verseline">O, what a fall was there, my countrymen!</p>
			<p class="verseline">Then I, and you, and all of us fell down,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Whilst bloody treason flourish’d over us</p>
			<p class="verseline">O, now you weep, and I perceive you feel</p>
			<p class="verseline">The dint of pity. These are gracious drops</p>
			<p class="verseline">Kind souls, what weep you when you but behold</p>

			<p class="verseline">That young Octavius and Mark Antony</p>
			<p class="verseline">Come down upon us with a mighty power,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Bending their expedition toward Philippi</p>
			<p class="character">Messala</p>
			<p class="verseline">Myself have letters of the selfsame tenure</p>
			<p class="character">Brutus</p>
			<p class="verseline">With what addition?</p>
			<p class="character">Messala</p>
			<p class="verseline">That by proscription and bills of outlawry</p>
			<p class="verseline">Octavius, Antony, and Lepidus</p>
			<p class="verseline">Have put to death an hundred senators</p>
			<p class="character">Brutus</p>

			<p class="verseline">Cicero one!</p>
			<p class="character">Messala</p>

			<p class="verseline">Now, as you are a Roman, tell me true</p>

			<p class="verseline">Then like a Roman bear the truth I tell:</p>
			<p class="verseline">For certain she is dead, and by strange manner</p>
			<p class="character">Brutus</p>
			<p class="verseline">Why, farewell, Portia. We must die, Messala</p>

			<p class="character">Cassius</p>
			<p class="verseline">I do not think it good</p>
			<p class="character">Brutus</p>
			<p class="verseline">Your reason?</p>
			<p class="character">Cassius</p>
			<p class="verseline">This it is:</p>
			<p class="verseline">‘Tis better that the enemy seek us;</p>
			<p class="verseline">So shall he waste his means, weary his soldiers,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Doing himself offense, whilst we lying still</p>

			<p class="verseline">The enemy, marching along by them,</p>
			<p class="verseline">By them shall make a fuller number up,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Come on refresh’d, new-added, and encouraged;</p>
			<p class="verseline">From which advantage shall we cut him off</p>
			<p class="verseline">If at Philippi we do face him there,</p>

			<p class="verseline">Hear me, good brother</p>
			<p class="character">Brutus</p>
			<p class="verseline">Under your pardon. You must note beside</p>
			<p class="verseline">That we have tried the utmost of our friends,</p>

			<p class="verseline">The enemy increaseth every day;</p>

			<p class="verseline">Which taken at the flood leads on to fortune;</p>
			<p class="verseline">Omitted, all the voyage of their life</p>
			<p class="verseline">Is bound in shallows and in miseries</p>
			<p class="verseline">On such a full sea are we now afloat,</p>
			<p class="verseline">And we must take the current when it serves,</p>

			<p class="character">Cassius</p>
			<p class="verseline">Then, with your will, go on;</p>
			<p class="verseline">We’ll along ourselves and meet them at Philippi</p>
